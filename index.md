I work as a Research Assistant at [The World Bank, Development Impact Evaluation (DIME) unit](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/dime). Before coming to DC, I worked also as an RA at [KDI School of Public Policy and Management](https://www.kdischool.ac.kr) in South Korea, [SoDa Labs @ Monash University](https://sodalabs.io/about.html), Australia, and [ITAM - IPA](https://www.itam.mx/) in Mexico City. My research interests are development economics, impact evaluations, labor market, and violence.
