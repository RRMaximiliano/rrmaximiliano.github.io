::: {#hero-heading}
:::

Welcome! I am a ~~first~~ second year PhD student in Education Policy and Program Evaluation (Economics of Education Field Course) at Harvard University. Before joining the PhD program, I was working as a research assistant at [The World Bank, Development Research Group](https://www.worldbank.org/en/research/) where I was evaluating an [adaptive experiment in Cameroon](https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/3514), an [RCT in Ukraine](https://www.socialscienceregistry.org/trials/10634), and building programming packages for impact evaluations.

Overall, my research interests are development economics, education, impact evaluations, and conflict. Notwithstanding that my work has been alongside several professors and researchers, I have also independently developed a portfolio of data projects that can be of help for future research, and, especially, for Nicaragua that can be found in the [software](/projects/) tab of this website.

Please feel free to contact me at the links provided on this website.
