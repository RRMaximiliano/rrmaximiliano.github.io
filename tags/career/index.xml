I have some very exciting news! I am joining the data team at @StackOverflow. ‚ú®üìä‚ú®üìä‚ú® ‚Äî Julia Silge (@juliasilge) December 13, 2016   Coming to Stack Overflow has been an adventure for me. This is my first time to work at an actual tech company. I have been what I like to think of as ‚Äútech adjacent‚Äù my whole career, writing code and working on technical questions but never before working at a straight-up web company.</description>
