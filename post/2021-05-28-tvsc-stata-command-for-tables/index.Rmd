## Balance tables

One of most common tables you tend to make in economics is a balance table. That is, we have two groups, and want to measure the differences between those groups for several variables. So, here it where `tsvc` enters. While we can perfom `t tests` on the equality of means using the ttest command in Stata, sometimes we (or atleast I) want to use several variables and maybe cluster our standard errors without creating a matrix or then export it to excel or latex.

The `tvsc` tests for statistically significant difference across a group that has two categories. You can install it by typing:

```stata
net install tvsc, from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rrmaximiliano/tvsc/main") replace
```

There are some dependencies here, since first the command will estimate a linear regression using the `redhdfe` package and then will use the `estout` package to show in your results windows the table.

## Example

Let's use the census data and create a dummy treatment variable: 

```stata
*** Load dataset
    sysuse census, clear 

*** Create treatment variable
    set seed 01237846
    gen treatment = (runiform()<.5)
```

The syntax of the `tsvc` is pretty straightforward:

```stata
tvsc varlist, by(group)
```

where _varlist_ is one or multiple variables that we would like to test for the, and in `by()` we add our treatment (group) variable. The command expects to have a treatment variable of the form 0 = control, and 1 = treatment. 

```stata
tvsc divorce marriage, by(treatment)
```

```stata
---------------------------------------------------
                Treatment      Control   Difference
---------------------------------------------------
divorce         18,379.07    30,425.36    -12046.29
               (2,630.31)   (7,183.07)   (7,011.02)
marriage        40,064.50    57,421.09    -17356.59
               (6,472.19)  (11,808.47)  (12,747.12)
---------------------------------------------------
```

### Options

If you don't include any option, you get the raw differences between treatment and control groups. You can use `sd` to show the standard deviations instead of the standard errors for both treatment and control groups but not for the difference. You can use the option `clus_id()` to estiamte clustered standard errors, and if you would like to include a 4th column using fixed effects, you can use the option `strat_id()`

1. Standard deviations instead of standard errors for treatment and control groups: 

```stata
tvsc divorce marriage, by(treatment) clus_id(region)
```

```stata
---------------------------------------------------
                Treatment      Control   Difference
---------------------------------------------------
divorce         18,379.07    30,425.36    -12046.29
               (2,630.31)   (7,183.07)   (7,374.89)
marriage        40,064.50    57,421.09    -17356.59
               (6,472.19)  (11,808.47)  (11,261.94)
---------------------------------------------------
```

2. Clustered standard errors for the difference

```stata
tvsc divorce marriage, by(treatment) clus_id(region)
```

```stata
---------------------------------------------------
                Treatment      Control   Difference
---------------------------------------------------
divorce         18,379.07    30,425.36    -12046.29
               (2,630.31)   (7,183.07)   (7,374.89)
marriage        40,064.50    57,421.09    -17356.59
               (6,472.19)  (11,808.47)  (11,261.94)
---------------------------------------------------
```

3. Fourth column using fixed effects:

```stata
tvsc divorce marriage, by(treatment) clus_id(region) strat_id(region)
```

```stata
----------------------------------------------------------------
                Treatment      Control         Diff      FE Diff
----------------------------------------------------------------
divorce         18,379.07    30,425.36    -12046.29    -13692.48
               (2,630.31)   (7,183.07)   (7,374.89)   (8,755.31)
marriage        40,064.50    57,421.09    -17356.59    -20555.04
               (6,472.19)  (11,808.47)  (11,261.94)  (12,263.35)
----------------------------------------------------------------
```

## Exporting

While the command does not have a built-in function that exports the results to excel or latex, I recommend using `esttab` after running `tvsc` as follows:


```stata
*** ssc install estout, replace
// Latex Table
local style "nomtitle nonumbers noobs b(3) se(3) booktabs"

quietly tvsc divorce marriage, by(treatment) clus_id(region) stra_id(region) labels
esttab, `style' cells("mu_2(fmt(%9.2fc)) mu_1(fmt(%9.2fc)) mu_3(fmt(%9.2fc))" "se_2(par) se_1(par) se_3(par)") 
```

And this should give you a latex output like this:

```stata
{
\def\sym#1{\ifmmode^{#1}\else\(^{#1}\)\fi}
\begin{tabular}{l*{1}{ccc}}
\toprule
            &   mu\_2/se\_2&   mu\_1/se\_1&   mu\_3/se\_3\\
\midrule
divorce     &   18,379.07&   30,425.36&   -12046.29\\
            &  (2,630.31)&  (7,183.07)&  (7,374.89)\\
marriage    &   40,064.50&   57,421.09&   -17356.59\\
            &  (6,472.19)& (11,808.47)& (11,261.94)\\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
}
```

In this case, to show the results you need to include the `cells` options where `mu_2` is the treatment, `mu_1` the control group, and `mu_3` the difference. Likewise, `se_2`, `se_1`, and `se_3` for the standard errors. If you want to get the standard deviations instead of the standard errors in your latex table, just change `se_` to `sd_`. And finally, if you used the `strat_id` option, the difference with fixed effects can be retrieved using `mu_4`.  

Personally, I always prefer to have only the body of the latex table instead of the full environment, and I get this by modifying the `esttab` options like this:


```stata
// Latex Table, just the body
local style "label nolines nogaps fragment nomtitle nonumbers noobs nodep collabels(none) booktabs b(3) se(3)"

quietly tvsc divorce marriage, by(treatment) clus_id(region) stra_id(region) labels
esttab, `style' cells("mu_2(fmt(%9.2fc)) mu_1(fmt(%9.2fc)) mu_3(fmt(%9.2fc))" "se_2(par) se_1(par) se_3(par)") 
```

And you should get this outputs:

```stata
Number of divorces  &   18,379.07&   30,425.36&   -12046.29\\
                    &  (2,630.31)&  (7,183.07)&  (7,374.89)\\
Number of marriages &   40,064.50&   57,421.09&   -17356.59\\
                    &  (6,472.19)& (11,808.47)& (11,261.94)\\
```
