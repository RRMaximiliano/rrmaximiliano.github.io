While I was running a bit more than 5000 regressions in Stata, a friend of mine asked me what I usually do after running and exporting my regressions; well, I had the brilliant and useless idea of creating a command in Stata that mimics the face I make every time my code fails to run. By typing `pikachu` you will get the following:

This uses only the `display` command to make pikachu's face. In order to install it, you will need to download the `ado` file from [here](/assets/ado-files/pikachu.ado) and place it in (or create) your personal ado folder.

> You can find the folder by typing `personal` in the command prompt.

And that's it. Now, you have pikachu reacting to your failures.

In case you don't know, the original meme is this one:
