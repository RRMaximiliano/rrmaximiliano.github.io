I would like to share some datasets that I have created or cleaned that might be helpful for other researchers.

## Presidential Elections (1990 - 2006)
To the best of my knowledge, there is no available (or open) dataset about elections in Nicaragua. Therefore, I took the statistical catalog of elections in Nicaragua (1990 - 2006) and extracted all the data from it. Unfortunately, the Supreme Electoral Council of Nicaragua website does not have information about the last two presidential elections. The current version is at the state level and I am planning to extract all the data at the municipal level.

## Political Prisoners (Apr 2018 - Feb 2019)
This dataset contains information about the political prisoners from the protest in Nicaragua since April 2018. The data comes from the ("Comité Pro Liberación de Presas y Presos Políticos")(http://presospoliticosnicaragua.com/).
