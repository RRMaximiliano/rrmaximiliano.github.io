I would like to share some datasets that I have created or cleaned and they might be helpful for other researchers. These datasets are from Nicaragua and cover interesting topics.

## Elections
To the best of my knowledge, there is no available (or open) dataset out there about elections in Nicaragua. Therefore, I took the statistical catalog of elections in Nicaragua (1990 - 2006) and extracted all the data from it. The current version is at the state level and I am planing to extract all the data at the municipal level.

## Political Prisoners (Apr 2018 - Feb 2019)
