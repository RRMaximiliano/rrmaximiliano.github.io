I am originally from Nicaragua. I attended the Universidad Centroamericana for my Bachelor studies, graduating with honors in applied economics in 2015.

I spent the next years in South Korea doing my Master's degree at KDI School of Public Policy. I graduated summa cum laude in August 2018. Since then, I have been working as a Research Assistant at KDI School. You can find details about my current work [here](/research).

My research interests are rooted in the fields of development economics and impact evaluations. I still need to complete this part of the website with more fascinating interests.

On a personal note, I play [Overwatch](overwatchleague.com) a lot. Nonetheless, I am still ~~silver~~ gold.
