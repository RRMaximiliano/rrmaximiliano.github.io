I am originally from Nicaragua. I attended Universidad Centroamericana for my bachelor studies, graduating with honors in applied economics in 2015.

I spent the next years in South Korea doing my Master's degree at KDI School of Public Policy where I graduated summa cum laude in August 2018. You can find details about my current work [here](/research).

On a personal note, I play [Overwatch](https://overwatchleague.com/). Nonetheless, I am still mid plat.
