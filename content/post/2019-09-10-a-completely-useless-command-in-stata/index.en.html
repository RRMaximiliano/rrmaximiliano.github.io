<p>While I was running a bit more than 5000 regressions in Stata, a friend of mine asked me what I usually do after running and exporting my regressions; well, I had the brilliant and useless idea of creating a command in Stata that mimics the face I make every time my code fails to run. By typing <code>pikachu</code> you will get the following:</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="figs/pikachu.gif" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Fig1</p>
</div>
<p>This uses only the <code>display</code> command to make pikachu’s face. In order to install it, you will need to download the <code>ado</code> file from <a href="adofiles/pikachu.ado">here</a> and place it in (or create) your personal ado folder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You can find the folder by typing <code>personal</code> in the command prompt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that’s it. Now, you have pikachu reacting to your failures. Finally, in case you don’t know, the original meme is this one:</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">Fig2</p>
</div>
